# Pima Diabetes Descriptive Statistics Assignment – Student Guide

Part 1: Load and Inspect Data
- Look at the first 5 rows. What do the columns represent?
- How many rows and columns are there?
- Are there any missing values? If yes, mention wich columns?

Part 2: Summary Statistics
- For each numerical column (Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigree, Age):
    - Compute mean, median, min, max, range, standard deviation, variance.
    - Observations: 
        - Which features vary the most (largest std/variance)?
        - Any surprising min or max values?.

Part 3: Distribution & Visualization
- Histograms & KDE: 
    - Observation: Is it symmetric, skewed left or right?
- Boxplots: identify potential outliers.
    - Observation: Which features have extreme values?
- Comparison by Outcome: Compare distributions of Glucose and BMI for Outcome = 0 vs 1.

    - Observation: Which group tends to have higher or lower values?

Part 4: Skewness & Kurtosis
- Skewness >0: right-skewed, <0: left-skewed.
- Kurtosis >0: heavy tails, <0: light tails.
    - Observation: Which features are close to normal? Which are skewed?

Part 5: Outliers
- Use the IQR method or boxplots.

- Observation: Which extreme values might affect the mean and standard deviation?
